shortest path planning on the terrain
A_Start_123_149
A* algorithm, the number of points it required is the set with 100â‰¤X/Y<100. Given source point and destination poin, it outputs all coordinates of an optimum path.

Aco_1
It is the code of shortest path to use simulated annealing algoruth. Given source point and destination poin, it outputs all coordinates of an optimum path.

Dijstra_7_dem
It is the shortest path algorithm to solve using Dijkstra algorithm.
1. A visual interface will appear when running directly
2. Interface 1: the interface for solving the shortest path. The shortest path can be given by selecting the corresponding starting point and destination point of the corresponding file and input according to the prompts.
3. Interface 2: is the interface of pruning treatment
4. Interface 3: the interface for generating map paths (this function can be abandoned, and ArcGIS can be directly used to generate paths as above)
